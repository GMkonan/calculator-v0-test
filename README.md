### Calculator test

Inspired by web-dev-cody video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFZ-g0w3OW4

Saw that and wanted to try myself as well, basically timing how much time it takes to build this calculator
that v0.dev made.

#### It took me:

20-30 minutes.

That's how it ended up:

Proportions are kinda off but I was working with an youtube video image so I'm gonna give myself a pass...
